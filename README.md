# Paint App

# Overview

I used C# to create a simple paint canvas application. Utilizing Visual Studio and its Forms feature, I was able to display my canvas and implement several functions to create a basic drawing tool. This project helped me to further my learning and skills as a software engineer by exploring graphical manipulation and event handling in C#.

The software I wrote demonstrates the C# language's capabilities in creating a graphical user interface (GUI) application. The primary purpose of writing this software was to deepen my understanding of C# and to apply it in a practical context, creating an interactive and visually engaging application.

You can watch a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code in the video below. The focus is on sharing what I learned about the language syntax and the development process.

# Running the Code

To run the paint canvas application, follow these steps:

1. **Open the Project in Visual Studio**

   - Launch Visual Studio.
   - Go to `File` -> `Open` -> `Project/Solution`.
   - Select the `.sln` file in the project folder and open it.

2. **Build and Run the Application**

   - Click on `Build` -> `Build Solution` to compile the project.
   - After the build completes, click `Debug` -> `Start Debugging` to run the application.

3. **Interact with the Application**

   - Use the mouse to draw on the canvas. Click and drag to create lines.

4. **Close the Application**

   - To stop the application, close the window or use `Shift+F5` in Visual Studio.

# Development Environment

To develop this software, I used the following tools:
- Visual Studio: The integrated development environment (IDE) for developing C# applications.
- .NET Framework: The framework for building and running Windows applications.

The programming language used was C#, and I utilized several libraries within the .NET Framework to handle graphical operations and user interactions.

- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)
- [C# Corner](https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/)

# Future Work

There are several things I plan to fix, improve, and add in the future:
- Improve the drawing performance and reduce flickering by implementing double buffering.
- Add user controls for changing the pen color and width.
- Implement save and load functionality to allow users to save their drawings or load previous drawings.
- Add more drawing tools, such as shapes and text.
- Enhance the user interface for a more intuitive and visually appealing experience.
